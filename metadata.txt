A JavaScript comment is a powerful programming construct to explain complex code blocks, what they do, and why they were implemented in a particular way. As systems and websites evolve, Developers always end up writing code that is complex. Code written this way might make complete sense to the original author or Developer, but might not be obvious to a Developer new to the team looking at the code for the very first time, or even to the authorâ€™s future self. In such cases, comments are a very powerful tool to explain the thought process and decisions made while writing a block of code.
